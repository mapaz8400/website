      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Melody Paz, I am currently an ACE student at Florida Gulf Coast University. I was born in Van Nuys, CA.,
        but I was raised in an extremely small town called Labelle, in Florida. I am a Software Engineering major with a minor in graphic
        designing. As much as I enjoy programming and software, my other hobbies include traveling, drawing, reading, and binge watching
        conspiracy theories.</p>
        <p>My fasination with technology began the day my father brought home a bright red iMac G3. As a two year old,
        I have a very vague memory, I just remember being mesmeorized by the bright screen and complicated wiring seen through the 
        translucent monitor. From then on, computers have been a huge part of my life and nothing excites me more than seeing
        all the progress we've made in technology.</p>
      <h2>Education Experience</h2>
        <ul id="ListEducation">
          <li>Florida Gulf Coast University - Where I took Computer Software & Technology and am currently
           taking Introduction to Computer Science.</li>
          <li>Florida Southwestern State College</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/283390552/">Animated Skit made using Scratch</a>     
      <h2>Usability/Accesibility</h2>
	 <h3>Document Structure and Screen Size</h3>
	       <p>I designed my website to be organized and easy to use. Each section has a header that describes it's contents. I made
		  sure to include in my underlying code, a feature that allows the website to adjust to any screen dimension. Whether it
		       be a phone, a computer, or a tablet.</p>
