        <p>My name is Melody Paz, I am currently an ACE student at Florida Gulf Coast University. I was born in Van Nuys, CA.,
        but I was raised in an extremely small town called Labelle, in Florida. I am a Software Engineering major with a minor in graphic
        designing. As much as I enjoy programming and software, my other hobbies include traveling, drawing, reading, and binge watching
        conspiracy theories.
        My fasination with technology began the day my father brought home a bright red iMac G3. As a two year old,
        I have a very vague memory, I just remember being mesmeorized by the bright screen and complicated wiring seen through the 
        translucent monitor. From then on, computers have been a huge part of my life and nothing excites me more than seeing
        all the progress we've made in technology.</p>
